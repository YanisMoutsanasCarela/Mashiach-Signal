Mashiach Signal: Your Guide in the Market
Illuminating the Path of Trading
Welcome to Mashiach Signal!
In the volatile world of trading, finding clarity and direction can be a challenge. "Mashiach Signal" has been designed with the deep intention of serving as a guide, a light that illuminates the path for traders, helping them identify true market pressure and make more informed decisions. Our goal is simple yet ambitious: to offer a tool that can empower the trading community, providing a clear perspective on underlying buying and selling forces.
What is Mashiach Signal?
Mashiach Signal is a custom indicator that intuitively visualizes buying and selling pressure in the market. Through a system of colored bars that oscillate above and below a zero line, it allows you to see at a glance which force dominates at any given moment and with what intensity.
How It Works
The indicator is displayed in a separate panel below your chart, with vertical bars of two main colors:
•	Blue Bars: Represent Buying Pressure.
•	Red Bars: Represent Selling Pressure.
•	Zero Line (Center): This horizontal line acts as the equilibrium point. Bars above zero indicate buying dominance, and bars below zero indicate selling dominance.
For Which Markets and Timeframes?
Mashiach Signal is a versatile tool that can be applied to a wide range of financial markets, including:
•	Forex (Currencies)
•	Stocks
•	Cryptocurrencies
•	Commodities
•	Indices
It is recommended to test and optimize its use across different timeframes (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, Daily) to find the one that best suits your trading style and the specific asset. Generally, it is more reliable in medium to long timeframes (1H, 4H, Daily) where "pressure" is more discernible, but it can offer valuable insights in shorter timeframes with practice.
